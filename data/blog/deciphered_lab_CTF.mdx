# CTF 2023

I participated in a Capture the Flag event conducted by [de.ci.phe.red Labs](http://de.ci.phe.red) as a team ```Kind Pandas``` alongside my teammates [Aditya Sankhla](https://github.com/adismort14) and [Ravinder Sharma](https://github.com/ChiefRavinder).

### Format 
- 22 hours hacking phase
- 10 total questions
- team of 3
- Dynamic scoring based on first to solve


### Results
We ended up winning!

That too with a decent lead of 5 points, which is significant considering the number of questions were relatively low. Shout out to RTFM (Readers of the friendly manual) and Team !Flag for the tight contest though, and congrats for finishing on the top, just behind us though :)

### Challenges 
- PRESENT : I am officially *Doronophobic* now.
- Time Schedule : All teammates had prior commitments so were not able to devote a lot of time, even if wanting too.



### Tips and Tricks

In case you are going to participate in a CTF any time soon, here are some tools and tricks I found useful.

- If you have received a file in the PS, do these first atleast:
    - `cat` filename (See the data in case there are any hints)
    - `file` filename (Maybe the metadata might help)
    - `binwalk` filename (see if something is hidding binwalk -e for extracting)
    - `strings` filename

- If you received a file is corrupted or the above didnt help.
    - Open the file using this tool [hexed.it](https://hexed.it/) , and try to extract info from the header

- any thing ending with == might potentially be base64 encoded. [fiddle with this tool](https://www.base64encode.org/)

- If you have a pcap file open with Wireshark and try to find anything unusual, do keep in mind if the about packet length and see if it is matching or not.

- A lot of questions are just about basic manipulation with the scripts. So do have command over basic scripting.
